1. Linear Search
  - Searching element through array by looping the array and checking each elements one by one
  - Worst case scenario ( can find only in the last index, or can't find at all) => O(n)
  - Best case scenario (found immediately in the first index) => Ω(1)
  
 2. Binary Search
  - Searching element thorough sorted array using divide and conquer method
  - Get first index and last index, get the middle index using those two, and compare with the target
  - If target is not the same with the middle one and larger than the middle one, change the start index to the middle one plus one, and repeat the process
  - If target is not the same with the middle one and smaller than the middle one, change the end index to the middle one minus one, and repeat the process
  - Worst case scenario (can find only in the last flow, or can't fin at all) => O (log n)
  - Best case scenario (found immediately in the first divide result) => Ω(1)
  
 3. Bubble Sort
  - Looping through array and comparing adjacent elements, and swap if the right one is greater than the left one, 
  - Leaving the highest number to the rightmost
  - Worst case scenario (the array is in reverse order, so we have to loop each index to each in the array) => O(n square)
  - Best case scenario (the array is in order already, so we have to loop only one time thorough the array) => Ω(n)
